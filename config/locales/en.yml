          We worked with Active Bridge as a young startup to build out our first MVP and subsequent updated products.
          Not only did their teams execute on the assigned tasks ahead of schedule, but they also contributed to our thinking around UX,
          asking probing questions and suggesting added features that we had not thought about.
          Overall this is an absolutely amazing team to work with, composed of driven developers and bright minds.
          We feel so incredibly lucky to be working with them

          We’ve been working with Active Bridge since August 2015.
          In the first six months, our application (marketplace in the sports industry)
          was built and launched with a team of 3 developers and a technical lead.
          The whole team were very responsive, organised and have great communication skills.
          Best of all, they were very proactive in suggesting improvements or pointing out potential issues in our plans –
          which we really appreciate as we don’t have an in-house technical team.
          After the active development phase, we’ve retained Active Bridge for the ongoing development and maintenance
          of our platform and I couldn’t recommend them enough.
